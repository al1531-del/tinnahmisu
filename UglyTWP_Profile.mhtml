<h1 style=3D"color: orange"> TRASH OF THE WEEK: KNOCKOFF FLUTTERSHY </h1>
	<img src=3D"https://tinnahmisu.neocities.org/fluttershypic.png">

<h2>Description:</h2>
  <p style=3D"background-color: yellow;">The item is a plastic figurine sma=
ll enough to fit in your palm and wrap all your fingers around. It is suppo=
sed to resemble the character <a href=3D"https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Flutte=
rshy">Fluttershy</a> from the children's cartoon television series <a href=
=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic">My L=
ittle Pony</a>. </p>
  <p>The original Fluttershy (a cartoon pony) has pink hair, a pale yellow =
body, and teal eyes. The toy, however, came in all yellow; all the pink mus=
t've rubbed off the wrapper. Her big cartoony eyes turned mysteriously mage=
nta as well.</p>
  <p>Knock-off Fluttershy shares the texture of the skin of any plastic dol=
l you might=E2=80=99ve played with as a child; not too smooth but not too r=
ough. It=E2=80=99s hard, but not hard enough to hurt if someone chucks it a=
t you from a considerable distance. I=E2=80=99m finally getting rid of it b=
ecause it is stinky and I don=E2=80=99t favor mysterious chemical smells. K=
nock-off Fluttershy had a good run sitting atop my dorm shelves for most of=
 my college career.</p>=20

<h2>Knockoff Fluttershy's Origin:</h2>
  <p> It was about an hour before our three-hour class, and my friend and I=
 were scavenging the dollar store a block away from the school building. If=
 I remember correctly, we were assigned to bring an item to class for an ac=
tivity, but neither of us prepared for this homework assignment ahead of ti=
me.</p>
 =20
  <p style=3D"background-color: yellow;">The weather was a little chilly as=
 autumn was making itself comfortable, sliding into October. It was freshma=
n year of college, and we had yet to explore downtown <a href=3D"https://en=
.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick"> New Brunswick</a>, so this also served =
as an excuse to look around the dollar store. We looked all around the stor=
e before officially deciding on what object to get. I looked around the bir=
thday decorations and enjoyed looking at the Halloween wigs since that was =
coming up. Finally, at the very bottom of the toy shelf, we found the blind=
 box toys. </p>
  <p> I liked My Little Pony as a child, and fortunately, so did my friend.=
 It was a popular show for a lot of kids during the 2010s, when this versio=
n released. We opened it together in class. </p>=20
